# Stock-Trading-Big-Data
CSCE 5300 project

The data_cleaning.ipynb file generates the csv that is used for training in the model.py file. The data is already in github so this does not need to be ran again.
The updated model can be run with python model2.py, and will run our simulation. Results are printed to the command line and predictions are saved to csv.
